# The Encoder
This is a basic encoding and decoding script using Python and a Cesar cipher.
Here's an example of encrypting:
```
Type 0 to encrypt or 1 to decrypt:  0
Please enter a message:  This is an example.
Please type a key from 0 to 26:  5
The encrypted message is Tmnx nx fs jcfruqj. with the key of 5 .
```
and here's an example of decrypting:
```
Type 0 to encrypt or 1 to decrypt:  1
Please enter the message:  Tmnx nx fs jcfruqj.
Please type the key:  5
The decrypted message is This is an example. .
```
This is an extended version of a [Raspberry Pi Python tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-messages/0). Everything was made on [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

I made it to test [PyScript](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript) and for people to have better access to it online. I made it through [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com).
The Trinket project is also availible [here](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript).
