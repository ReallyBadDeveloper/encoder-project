# The Encoder
This is a basic encoding and decoding script using Python and a Cesar cipher.
Here's an example of encrypting:
```
Type 0 to encrypt or 1 to decrypt:  0
Please enter a message:  This is an example.
Please type a key from 0 to 26:  5
The encrypted message is Tmnx nx fs jcfruqj. with the key of 5 .
```
and here's an example of decrypting:
```
Type 0 to encrypt or 1 to decrypt:  1
Please enter the message:  Tmnx nx fs jcfruqj.
Please type the key:  5
The decrypted message is This is an example. .
```
